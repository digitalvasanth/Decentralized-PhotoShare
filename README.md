# Open-Image-Exchange
This project enables decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain, utilizing Solidity for smart contracts and React for the front-end interface. It allows users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.




#Technologied Used:-
1. Solidity for smart contract development.
2. IPFS for Decentralised storage protocol.
3. React for the UI Interface.
